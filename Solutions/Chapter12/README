Notes on Chapter 12 code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The code in this directory comes in three sorts. Most examples are given in 
the Hugs/Gofer ADT mechanism, and these are in the files such as

	Section12-13.g

Note that these files are valid for both Hugs1.01 and Hugs0 (June 1996).

An example of the Haskell-style of ADT mechanism is given in 

	Section12-4.hs

Note that this can be used in Hugs0.

Because of the differences in class and module mechanisms between Hugs1.01,
Hugs0 and Gofer, the examples of Sections 12.9 and 12.10 are in three sorts
of file:

	<file>.g	Gofer only
	<file>.hugs	Hugs1.01 only
	<file>.hugs0	Hugs0 only
