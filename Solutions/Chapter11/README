Readme file for Huffman coding in Chapter 11
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note that the code for this chapter is given in logical modules rather than in
separate sections.


Hugs1.01 and Gofer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use the Huffman code modules in Hugs or Gofer type 

	:p Project

to the appropriate interpreter.

Hugs0 (The Yale release of Hugs, June 1996)
^^^^^
To load the system type

:l Types.hs CodeTable.hs Frequency.hs Coding.hs MakeTree.hs MakeCode.hs Main.hs


Glasgow Haskell
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Also checked under the Glasgow compiler version 0.19.

Note how there were compiled:

	ghc -c -O <file>.hs

in dependency order, then are linked by

	ghc -o wiggle  -O *.o



Haskell 1.3
^^^^^^^^^^^

Note that to conform to Haskell 1.3 certain changes as documented in the
text need to be made to the import statements. Instead of importing all the
contents of module Bee by writing

	Bee ..

one writes

	module Bee

and so on.
